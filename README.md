## ⌈ what is mono ⌋

`mono` is a **web-based operating system** built around a persistent AI companion.

it’s not a chatbot.  
it’s not a dashboard.  
it’s a **desktop**.

a place where:
- every interaction is a terminal
- apps are windows, not pages
- the ai is *present*, not hidden
- text → voice → expression → response

mono exists somewhere between:
os ── terminal ── vtuber ── ai agent

---

## ⌈ philosophy ⌋

> build in public  
> ship fast  
> stay online too long  
> caffeine instead of sleep  

mono is being built by:
- a full-time coder
- a soon-to-be vtuber
- a hikikomori with too many tabs open
- a pump.fun survivor
- someone who lives in terminals and hates unnecessary UI

this project is:
- personal
- obsessive
- long-term
- constantly evolving
